1. Explain the relationship between the "product" and "product_category" entities from the above diagram.
Answer: The diagram depicts an Entity-Relationship Model (ERD).
The “product” entity is related to the “product_category” entity through a foreign key relationship.
Specifically, the “category_id” attribute in the “product” table serves as a foreign key that references the primary key “id” of the “product_category” table.
This relationship ensures that each product is associated with a valid category.



2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Answer: To ensure that each product in the “product” table has a valid category assigned:
Make the “category_id” field in the “product” table NOT NULL. This enforces that every product must have a category assigned.
Use foreign key constraints to ensure that the “category_id” corresponds to a valid “id” in the “product_category” table.
